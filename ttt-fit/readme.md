# Fitting of time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams

This folder contains the source data and Python script for the fitting of JMAK model parameters based on digitised TTT diagrams. The reference data is stored in the file ``ttt-diagram_100cr6_kaymak.csv`` and based on the diagram published in [@kaymak2007]. 

By executing the python scrip ``fit_jmak_parameters_100cr6.py``, all variants for the fitting of the parameters are performed, and the TTT diagrams published in the paper are recreated. The final polynomial coefficients are also printed.
